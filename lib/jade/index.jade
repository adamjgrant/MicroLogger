  h1 Micrologger proof of concept

  :markdown
    By [Adam Grant](http://adamgrant.me) |  [Copy the Snippet](https://github.com/adamjgrant/Test-Runner/blob/master/lib/js/micrologger.js) (v0.0.1)

  p
    strong Open your browser's JavaScript console to see Micrologger work.

  ul
    li: a(href="#about") About
    li: a(href="#examples") Examples

  p#about Micrologger is the JavaScript testing framework that is always running, making sure each and every interaction from your users behaves as expected.

  h2 How is this different from other testing frameworks like Mocha.js?

  p Micrologger is designed to be used, not only during CI but on production itself. This is because test failures can sometimes be the result of particularities in the user's context.

  p Wouldn't it be nice to be notified when a user sees a JavaScript error and what the context of that error was?

  h3 Conceptual differences

  p Assertions and expectations are two-sided. The first side lives on the user's interaction

  :markdown
    <span>

        var requestNews = function() {
          // Expect that a list of news articles will be returned.
        }

  p And the other side lives on the application.

  :markdown
    <span>

        var getNewsViaAJAX = function() {
          // Return whatever data was fetched to that expectation.
        }

  p Micrologger also exposes the reporting functions for passed and failed tests, allowing you to use for 3rd party reporting tools like Mixpanel
  p Just override <code>$ml.pass(message)</code> and <code>$ml.fail(message, args)</code>.

  :markdown
    <span>

        $ml.pass = function(message) {
          mixpanel.track("Successful interaction", { message: message });
        }

        $ml.fail = function(message args) {
          mixpanel.track("Error", { message: message, args: JSON.stringify(args) });
        }

  h3 Stupidly small

  :markdown
    The idea of loading a testing framework as a dependency on production doesn't sound very tempting, 
    so Micrologger [has been made very small and simple](https://github.com/adamjgrant/MicroLogger/blob/master/lib/js/micrologger.js), 
    relying on built in JavaScript logic for testing. The additional load is truly negligible.

  h1#examples Examples

  p The button on the left will expect you to press the button on the right in three seconds.
  p Open your console to see Micrologger output.
  button#first Press me first
  &nbsp;
  button#second Press me second

  h2 What happened?

  p On the event listener for <strong>Button 1</strong> we registered a simple assertion

  pre $ml.waitForButton = new $ml.Assert("button was pressed in less than 3 seconds", 3000);

  p On the event listener for <strong>Button 2</strong> we simply made a call to the function we created from button 1.

  pre $ml.waitForButton.respond()

  p <code>waitForButton</code> is a custom name, you can create any name you want after <code>$ml</code>

  h1 Specs

  p We can also bundle tests into specs. Let's use the same example but we want to see that the second button is pressed both less than 3 and less than 5 seconds.

  button#third Press me first
  &nbsp;
  button#fourth Then press me

  h2 What happened?

  p When we pressed the first button, the event listener created a new spec with two assertions.

  :markdown
    <span>

        $ml.specs.waitTwiceForButton = new $ml.Spec([
          $ml.waitForButton = new $ml.Assert("button was pressed in less than 3 seconds", 3000),
          $ml.waitForButton = new $ml.Assert("button was pressed in less than 5 seconds", 5000)
        ]);

  p On the second button, again, we just call <code>respond</code> on the function we created in button 1's event listener.

  :markdown
    <span>

        $ml.specs.waitTwiceForButton.respond();

  h1 Expect

  p How about conditional logic? Let's use <code>Expect</code> to compare two numbers.

  p This button will check if the variable is equal to 1.

  button#getone Check for 1

  p Now these two buttons will set a variable equal to 1 or 2 respectively. And run the test.

  button#setone 1
  &nbsp;
  button#settwo 2

  h2 What happened?

  p First, our get one button set up an expectation

  :markdown
    <span>

        $ml.getOne = new $ml.Expect("variable is set to 1", function(variable) {
          return variable === 1; // We'll use plain old JavaScript to return true or false.
        });

  p Next, each of our buttons set the return value. We could have also done this in reverse order and called <code>respond<code> on the button that did the expectation.

  :markdown
    <span>

        // Button 1's event listener
        var someVar = 1;
        $ml.getOne.respond(someVar);

        // Button 2's event listener
        var someVar = 2;
        $ml.getOne.respond(someVar);

  h1 Adding it all together

  p Now let's use both assertions and expectations in a spec.

  p We expect that a variable is set to 1 in less than 3 seconds

  button#final First, let's begin the timer

  p Now, one of these will need to be pressed in less than 3 seconds and sets the var equal to 1.

  button#setonetwo Set 1
  &nbsp;
  button#settwotwo Set 2

  h2 What happened?

  p In the first button's event listener, we created a spec.

  :markdown
    <span>

        $ml.specs.getOneQuickly = new $ml.Spec([
          new $ml.Expect("variable is set to 1", function(variable) {
            return variable === 1;
          }),
          new $ml.Assert("variable is set in less than 3 seconds", 3000);
        ]);

  p Now each button just needs to return the variable to the spec function we created.

  :markdown
    <span>

        // Button 1's event listener
        someVar = 1
        $ml.specs.getOneQuickly.respond(someVar);

        // Button 2's event listener
        someVar = 2
        $ml.specs.getOneQuickly.respond(someVar);
